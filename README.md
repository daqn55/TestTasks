# TestTasks

Task 2

To calculate the net salary you need just to write gross value.

To add new taxes you must use the command AddNewTax (Case insensitive) and it will ask you to add three values:

- Tax name => Name of the new tax.

- Tax rate => It must be integer.

- Upper tax limit => It's not taxing higher than this tax limit.

There are two more commands:

- "Help": It's show you all commands.
- "Exit": Quits the program.
